# Getting Started with Create React App

Quiz App (React) – Open Trivia DB
=================================

Features
--------
- Fetches 10 multiple-choice questions from Open Trivia DB
- Renders one question at a time with 4 options
- Progress indicator and 30s per-question timer
- Prevents advancing without a selection (auto-advance when timer ends)
- Results page with detailed answer summary
- Persistent high scores via localStorage
- Responsive layout

Getting Started
---------------
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

Build
-----
```bash
npm run build
```

Routing
-------
- `/quiz` – quiz flow
- `/results` – final score and answers

Tech Notes
----------
- React functional components with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`)
- Routing via `react-router-dom@6`
- Styles in `src/App.css`
- Fetch timeout and double-click guard implemented

Deployment
----------
You can deploy with GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. For CRA, the simplest is Netlify/Vercel: build and drag-drop the `build` folder or connect the repo.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
